These scripts are used to build a version of rpm + zypper that can allows use without sudo priveleges.
A new command line option is added to rpm, '--nochroot', which prepends the '--root' path to all file operations.
Zypper has also been modified to use '--nochroot' and '--noscripts' when invoking rpm.

So that these utilities will not interfere with ones already installed, a program prefix of 'prof-' is used
and they are installed in /opt/profbuild.  In addition, they are built with static libraries, to make them
easier to copy into other locations.

To get host packages needed to build either rpm or zypper:
    packages_fedora.sh

To get the rpm and zypper sources:
    getsource.sh
